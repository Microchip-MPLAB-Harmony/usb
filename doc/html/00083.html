The USB Driver operates or can operate in the Host mode when it is initialized for Host mode or Dual Role operation. When operating in Host mode, the USB Driver is also referred to as the Host Controller Driver (HCD). In Dual Role mode, the USB Driver will switch to Host mode when the USB Driver Host Root Hub Operation Enable function is called.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Element10">
The USB Driver Client must perform these steps to operate the USB Driver in Host mode.</p>
<ol class="Element630">
<li value="1" class="Element600">Open the USB Driver to obtain the driver handle.</li>
<li value="2" class="Element600">Set the event handler.</li>
<li value="3" class="Element600">Call the Root Hub Control function to obtain the speed of the root hub, the number of ports that the root hub supports, and the maximum current that the root hub VBUS can supply.</li>
<li value="4" class="Element600">Calls the Root Hub Initialize function with an identifier parameter. This <span class="Element146">identifier</span> parameter allows the Host Stack to uniquely identify the root hub when where there are multiple root hubs.</li>
<li value="5" class="Element600">The Driver Client will then enable the root hub operation and will wait until the root hub operation is enabled.</li>
<li value="6" class="Element600">The Driver Client can now call the USB Driver Host mode functions.</li>
</ol><p class="Element10">
The following sections explain Steps 2 through 6 in more detail.</p><div class="Element15">
Handling Host Mode Driver Events</div>
<p class="Element10">
Currently, the HCD does not provide any events to the client. The client can optionally register an event handler through the eventHandlerSet function pointer in the DRV_USB_HOST_INTERFACE structure. Future releases of the USB Driver may contain features that provide events to the Driver Client. Please refer to the following <strong>Root Hub Operation</strong> section for details on how the driver indicates device attach and detach to the client.</p><div class="Element15">
Root Hub Operation</div>
<p class="Element10">
A key feature of the HCD is the Root Hub Driver. The Root Hub Driver emulates hub operation in USB Driver software and provides a hub like interface to the USB Host Layer. The USB Host Layer treats the root hub like an external hub. This simplifies the implementation of USB Host Layer while supporting multiple devices through a hub. In that, the USB Host layer does not have to treat a device connected directly to the USB peripheral differently than a device connected to an external hub. The following code example shows how the USB Host Layer calls the root hub function to obtain information about the root hub. </p><div class="Element13"><div class="Element12"><pre class="Element12"><i><span style="color: #008000">/* This code example shows how the USB Host Layer calls the root hub functions to

Opening and Closing a Pipe</div>
<p class="Element10">
The HCD client can open a pipe to the device after resetting the device. The USB Host Layer calls the hostPipeSetup function in the DRV_USB_HOST_INTERFACE structure to open a pipe. The USB Host Layer must open a pipe to communicate to a specific endpoint on a target device. While opening the pipe, the USB Host Layer must specify parameters which specify the address of the target device, the type of the transfer that the pipe must support and the speed of the pipe. If the device is connected to a hub, the address of the hub must be specified. The HCD Pipe Setup function <i>is not</i> interrupt-safe. It should not be called in any event handler that executes in an interrupt context.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Element10">
The Pipe Setup function returns a valid pipe handle if the pipe was opened successfully. Pipe creation may fail if the target device was disconnected or if there are insufficient resources to open the pipe.

An open pipe consumes computational and memory resources and must therefore must be closed if it will not be used. This is especially true of pipes to a device that is detached.

Transferring Data to an Attached Device</div>
<p class="Element10">
The USB Host Layer, the HCD client, needs to transfer data to the attached device to understand the device capabilities and to operate the device. The HCD uses a concept of Input Output Request Packet (IRP) to transfer data to and from the attached device. IRPs are transported over pipes which are setup by calling the USB Driver Pipe Setup function.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Element10">
A Host IRP is a USB_HOST_IRP type data structure. The IRP is created by the Host layer and submitted to the HCD for processing through the hostIRPSubmit function. At the time of submitting the IRP, the pipe over which the IRP must be transported is specified. The data request in the IRP is transported using the attributes of pipe. When an IRP is submitted to the HCD, it is owned by the HCD and cannot be modified by the Host Layer until the HCD issues an IRP callback. The HCD will issue the IRP callback when it has completed or terminated processing of the IRP.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Element10">
An IRP does not have its own transfer type. It inherits the properties of the pipe to which it is submitted. Hence an IRP becomes a control transfer IRP it was submitted to a control transfer pipe. A pipe allows multiple IRPs to be queued. This allows the Host Layer to submit IRPs to a pipe even while an IRP is being processed on the pipe. The HCD will process an IRP in the order that it was received. The following code example shows the USB_HOST_IRP data structure. </p><div class="Element13"><div class="Element12"><pre class="Element12"><i><span style="color: #008000">/* The following code example shows the USB_HOST_IRP structure.

Any hardware specific cache coherency and address alignment requirements must be considered while allocating this data buffer. The Driver Client should not modify or examine the contents of the IRP after the IRP has been submitted and is being processed. It can be examined after the driver has released the IRP.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Element10">
The <span class="Element146">size</span> member of the USB_HOST_IRP structure contains the size of the transfer. for Bulk transfers, the size of the transfer can exceed the size of the transaction (which is equal to size of the endpoint reported by the device). The HCD in such a case will split up the transfer into transactions. This process does not require external intervention. For control transfers, the size of the transfer is specified in the setup packet (pointed to by the <span class="Element146">setup</span> member of the USB_HOST_IRP structure). The driver will itself process the Setup, Data (if required) and Handshake stages of control transfer. This process again does not require external intervention. For interrupt and isochronous transfers, the size of transfer specified in the IRP cannot exceed the size of the transaction. If size is specified as 0, then the driver will send a zero length packet. The <span class="Element146">size</span> parameter of the IRP is updated by the driver when IRP processing is completed. This will contain the size of the completed transfer.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Element10">
The <span class="Element146">status</span> member of the IRP provides the completion status of the IRP and should be checked only when the IRP processing has completed. This is indicated by the driver calling the IRP callback function. The IRP status is a USB_HOST_IRP_STATUS type. The following code example shows the different possible values of the <span class="Element146">status</span> member and an example of submit a control transfer IRP. </p><div class="Element13"><div class="Element12"><pre class="Element12"><i><span style="color: #008000">/* The following code shows an example of how the Host Layer populates

<p class="Element10">
The <span class="Element146">flags</span> member of the USB_HOST_IRP structure specifies flags which affect the behavior of the IRP. The USB_HOST_IRP_FLAG enumeration specifies the available option. The USB_HOST_IRP_FLAG_SEND_ZLP causes the driver to add a Zero Length Packet (ZLP) to the data stage of the transfer when the transfer size is an exact multiple of the endpoint size. The USB_HOST_IRP_WAIT_FOR_ZLP flag will cause the driver to wait for a ZLP from the device in a case where the size of data received thus far in the transfer is an exact multiple of the endpoint size.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Element10">
The <span class="Element146">callback</span> member of the USB_HOST_IRP structure points to a function which the driver calls when the IRP processing is completed. The Driver Client must implement this function and assign the pointer to this function to the <span class="Element146">callback</span> member of the IRP. Every IRP can have its own callback function or one common callback function could be used. The callback function will execute in an interrupt context. The Driver Client should not execute interrupt unsafe, blocking, or computationally intensive operations in the callback function. The client can call hostIRPSubmit function in the IRP callback function to submit another IRP or resubmit the same IRP. The client can check the status and size of the IRP in the callback function.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Element10">
The <span class="Element146">userData</span> member of the USB_HOST_IRP structure can be used by the client to associate a client specific context with the Host. This context can then be used by the client, in the IRP callback function to identify the context in which the IRP was submitted. This member is particularly useful if the client wants to implement one callback function for all IRPs.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Element10">
The <span class="Element146">privateData</span> member of the IRP is used by the driver and should not be accessed or manipulated by the Driver Client. The following code examples show usage of IRPs to transfer data between the Host and the attached device and along with the different flags. </p><div class="Element13"><div class="Element12"><pre class="Element12"><i><span style="color: #008000">/* The following code shows an example of submitting an IRP to send data
