/* USB Device HID Function Driver Events

  Summary:
    USB Device HID Function Driver Events

  Description:
    These events are specific to the USB Device HID Function Driver instance.
    Each event description contains details about the  parameters passed with
    event. The contents of pData depends on the generated event.
    
    Events that are associated with the HID Function Driver Specific Control
    Transfers require application response. The application should respond to
    these events by using the USB_DEVICE_ControlReceive,
    USB_DEVICE_ControlSend and USB_DEVICE_ControlStatus functions.
    
    Calling the USB_DEVICE_ControlStatus function with a
    USB_DEVICE_CONTROL_STATUS_ERROR will stall the control transfer request.
    The application would do this if the control transfer request is not
    supported. Calling the USB_DEVICE_ControlStatus function with a
    USB_DEVICE_CONTROL_STATUS_OK will complete the status stage of the control
    transfer request. The application would do this if the control transfer
    request is supported 
    
    The following code snippet shows an example of a possible event handling
    scheme.

  Remarks:
    Some of the events allow the application to defer responses. This allows the
    application some time to obtain the response data rather than having to
    respond to the event immediately. Note that a USB host will typically wait
    for event response for a finite time duration before timing out and
    canceling the event and associated transactions. Even when deferring
    response, the application must respond promptly if such timeouts have to be
    avoided.

    parameters is given here.

  Description:
    This function registers a event handler for the specified HID function

    must be registered for function driver to respond to function driver 
    specific commands. If the event handler is not registered, the device
    layer will stall function driver specific commands and the USB device
    may not function. 
    
  Precondition:
    This function should be called when the function driver has been initialized
    as a result of a set configuration.

  Parameters:

  Summary:
    This function submits the buffer to HID function driver library to

  Description:
    This function places a request to send a HID report with the USB Device HID
    Function Driver Layer. The function places a requests with driver, the
    request will get serviced when report is requested by the USB Host. A handle
    to the request is returned in the transferHandle parameter. The termination
    of the request is indicated by the USB_DEVICE_HID_EVENT_REPORT_SENT event.
    The amount of data sent, a pointer to the report and the transfer handle
    associated with the request is returned along with the event in the pData
    parameter of the event handler.  The transfer handle expires when event
    handler for the USB_DEVICE_HID_EVENT_REPORT_SENT exits. If the send request
    could not be accepted, the function returns an error code and transferHandle
    will contain the value USB_DEVICE_HID_TRANSFER_HANDLE_INVALID.

  Precondition:

  Parameters:
    instance  - USB Device HID Function Driver instance.

    transferHandle - Pointer to a USB_DEVICE_HID_TRANSFER_HANDLE type of
                     variable. This variable will contain the transfer handle

    data - pointer to the data buffer containing the report to be sent.
    
    size - Size (in bytes) of the report to be sent.

    and its processing has not started, then the transfer is canceled

    depending on the transaction that is presently in progress. If the last
    transaction of the transfer is in progress, then the transfer will not be
    canceled.  If it is not the last transaction in progress, the in-progress
    will be allowed to complete. Pending transactions will be canceled. The
    first transaction of an in progress transfer cannot be canceled.

  Precondition:
    The USB Device should be in a configured state.

  Parameters:
    instanceIndex  - HID Function Driver instance index.

    transferHandle - Transfer handle of the transfer to be canceled.
    
  Returns:

    USB_DEVICE_HID_RESULT_ERROR_INSTANCE_INVALID - Invalid HID instance index
    
    USB_DEVICE_HID_RESULT_ERROR - The transfer could not be canceled because it
                              has either completed, the transfer handle is 
                              invalid or the last transaction is in progress.
