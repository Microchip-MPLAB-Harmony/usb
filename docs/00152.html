<p class="Element10">
The USB Device Layer, the USBCD client, needs to transfer data to the Host in response to enumeration requests for general operation on the device. The USB uses a concept of Input Output Request Packet (IRP) to transfer data to and from the Host. IRPs are transported over endpoints which are enabled by calling the USBCD Endpoint Enable function.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Element10">
A Device IRP is a USB_DEVICE_IRP type data structure. The IRP is created by the Device Layer and submitted to the USBCD for processing through the deviceIRPSubmit function. At the time of submitting the IRP, the endpoint over which the IRP must be transported is specified. The data request in the IRP is transported using the attributes of the endpoint. When an IRP is submitted to the USBCD, it is owned by the USBCD and cannot be modified by the Device Layer until the USBCD issues an IRP callback. The USBCD will issue the IRP callback when it has completed or terminated processing of the IRP.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Element10">
An IRP does not have its own transfer type. It inherits the properties of the endpoint to which it is submitted. Hence an IRP becomes a control transfer IRP it was submitted to a control endpoint. An endpoint allows multiple IRPs to be queued. This allows the Device Layer to submit IRPs to an endpoint even while an IRP is being processed on the endpoint. The USBCD will process an IRP in the order that it was received. The following code example shows the USB_DEVICE_IRP data structure: </p><div class="Element13"><div class="Element12"><pre class="Element12"><i><span style="color: #008000">/* This code example shows the USB_DEVICE_IPR structure.

<p class="Element10">
The <span class="Element146">data</span> member of the USB_DEVICE_IRP structure points to a data buffer. This data buffer will contain the data that needs to be sent to the Host for the data stage of an IN transfer. For an OUT transfer, it will contain the data that was received from the Host. Any hardware specific cache coherency and address alignment requirements must be considered while allocating this data buffer. The Driver Client should not modify or examine the contents of the IRP after the IRP has been submitted and is being processed. It can be examined after the driver has released the IRP.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Element10">
The <span class="Element146">size</span> member of the USB_DEVICE_IRP structure specifies the size of the data buffer. The transfer will end when the device has sent or received size number of bytes. While sending data to the Host, the IRP size can exceed the size of the transaction (which is equal to the size of the endpoint). The USBCD in such a case will split up the transfer into transactions. This process does not require external intervention. The driver uses receive and transmit IRPs to process control transfers. When the driver receives a Setup packet, the IRP completion status would be USB_DEVICE_IRP_STATUS. The Driver Client should then use additional receive and transmit IRPs to complete the control transfer.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Element10">
For interrupt and isochronous transfers, the size of transfer specified in the IRP cannot exceed the size of the transaction. If size is specified as 0, then the driver will send or expect a zero length packet. The <span class="Element146">size</span> parameter of the IRP is updated by the driver when IRP processing is completed. This will contain the size of the completed transfer.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Element10">
The <span class="Element146">status</span> member of the IRP provides the completion status of the IRP and should be checked only when the IRP processing has completed. This is indicated by the driver calling the IRP callback function. The IRP status is a USB_DEVICE_IRP_STATUS type. The following code example shows the different possible values of the <span class="Element146">status</span> member and example usage of IRPs to transfer data between the device and the Host. </p><div class="Element13"><div class="Element12"><pre class="Element12"><i><span style="color: #008000">/* The followoing code shows example usage of the device IRP.

The Driver Client must implement this function and assign the pointer to this function to the <span class="Element146">callback</span> member of the IRP. Every IRP can have its own callback function or one common callback function could be used. The callback function will execute in an interrupt context. The Driver Client should not execute interrupt unsafe, blocking or computationally intensive operations in the callback function. The client can call deviceIRPSubmit function in the IRP callback function to submit another IRP or resubmit the same IRP. The client can check the status and size of the IRP in the callback function.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Element10">
The <span class="Element146">userData</span> member of the USB_DEVICE_IRP structure can be used by the client to associate a client specific context with the Host.
