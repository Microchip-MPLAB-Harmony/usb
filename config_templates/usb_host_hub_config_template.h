/* USB Host Hub Instances Number 
 
  Summary: 
    Specifies the number of Hub to be supported in the system.

  Description:
    This configuration constant defines the total number of hubs to be supported
    in the application. This includes hubs connected across multiple USBs. If
    the hub connected to the host exceed this number, then the additional hubs
    will not be enumerated.

  Remarks:
    Increasing number of Hubs to be supported will also increase memory
    consumption.

/* USB Host Hub Number of Ports per Hub 
 
  Summary: 
    Specifies the number of ports per Hub.

  Description:
    This configuration macros specifies the number of Ports per Hub. If any Hub
    connected to host will a have a maximum of 4 ports, then this number should
    be set to 4. A hub with more ports than the value defined by this constant
    will not be supported.

  Remarks:
    Supporting a hub with more ports increases the memory requirement.
