/* USB Host MSD Client Driver Instances Number.
  
  Summary:
    Defines the maximum number of MSD devices to be supported by this host
    application. 

  Description:
    This constant defines the maximum number of MSD devices to be supported by
    this host application. For example, if 3 USB Pen Drives need to be
    supported, then this value should be 3. This value cannot be greater than
    USB_HOST_DEVICES_NUMBER, which defines the maximum number of devices to be
    supported in the application. If this constant is less than
    USB_HOST_DEVICES_NUMBER, then only USB_HOST_MSD_INSTANCES_NUMBER of MSD
    devices will be enumerated.
    
  Remarks:
    None

/* USB Host MSD Client Driver LUNs Number.
  
  Summary:
    Defines the maximum number of MSD Device LUNs to be supported in the
    application.

  Description:
    An MSD device may have mutliple storage units, each addressable through a
    LUN number. An example is a USB Card reader with multiple card slots. Each
    card slot has a LUN number. The USB_HOST_MSD_LUNS_NUMBER constant defines
    the maximum number of such logical units that can be managed by the USB Host
    application. This number should atleast be equal to
    USB_HOST_MSD_INSTANCES_NUMBER. To configure this value, consider an example
    of an application that will support a maximum of 2 USB Storage device. These
    2 storage devices are expected to have at the most 3 LUNs each. Then the the
    USB_HOST_MSD_LUNS_NUMBER constant should be set to 6 (2 devices and 3 LUNs
    per device)/ 
    
  Remarks:
    None
