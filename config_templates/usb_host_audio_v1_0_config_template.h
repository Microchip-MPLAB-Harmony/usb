/* USB Host Audio v1.0 Maximum Number of Instances

  Summary:
    Specifies the number of Audio v1.0 instances.

  Description:
    This macro defines the number of instances of the Audio v1.0 host Driver. For
    example, if the application needs to implement two instances of the Audio v1.0
    host Driver should be set to 2. 

  Remarks:
    None.

/* USB Host Audio v1.0 Attach Listeners Number 
 
  Summary: 
    Defines the number of attach event listeners that can be registered with Audio v1.0
    Host Client Driver. 

  Description:
    The USB Audio v1.0 Host Client Driver provides attach notification to listeners who
    have registered with the client driver via the
    USB_HOST_AUDIO_V1_0_AttachEventHandlerSet() function. The
    USB_HOST_AUDIO_V1_0_ATTACH_LISTENERS_NUMBER configuration constant defines the
    maximum number of event handlers that can be set. This number should be set
    to equal the number of entities that interested in knowing when a Audio v1.0 device
    is attached.

  Remarks:
    None.

/* USB Host Audio v1.0 Streaming Interfaces Number 
 
  Summary: 
    Defines the maximum number of streaming interfaces could be present in an 
    Audio v1.0 device that this Audio v1.0 Host Client Driver can support. 

  Description:
    This configuration constant defines maximum number of streaming interfaces
    could be present in an Audio v1.0 device that this Audio v1.0 Host Client 
    Driver can support. The value of this constant should be atleast 1.
    
    Example 1 - If the USB Audio v1.0 Host application must support a USB 
    Headset, this constant should be set 2 as an Audio Headset will have 
    atleast 2 Audio Streaming interfaces, one for Host to Device streaming
    and one for Device to Host streaming. 
    
    Example 2 - If the USB Audio v1.0 Hos t application must support a USB 
    Speaker, this constant should be set 1 as an Audio Speaker will have 
    atleast 1 Audio Streaming interface. 

  Remarks:
    Supporting multiple streaming interfaces requires more data memory and 
    processing time.

/* USB Host Audio v1.0 Streaming interface alternate setting number 
 
  Summary: 
    Defines maximum number of alternate settings per Streaming interface  
    provided by any Device that will be connected to this Audio Host.

  Description:
    This configuration constant defines maximum number of Streaming interface
    alternate settings provided by any Device that will be connected to this 
    Audio Host. The value of this constant should be at-least 1.
    
    Example  - If the USB Audio v1.0 Host application must support a USB 
    Audio Device with 2 alternate settings including Alternate Setting 0 
	then this constant should be defined to 3.  

  Remarks:
    Supporting multiple alternate settings per streaming interfaces requires 
    more data memory and processing time.
