/* MSD Function Driver Instances Number
 
  Summary:
    Number of MSD function Driver instances required in the USB Device.

  Description:
    This configuration constant defines the number of MSD Function Driver
    instances in the USB Device. This value should be atleast 1 if the MSD
    function is required. In case where multiple MSD function drivers are
    required, it should be noted the MSD function driver supports multiple LUNs.
    This allows one MSD function driver instance to manage multiple media. Using
    multiple LUNs can be considered as an alternative to using multiple MSD
    function driver instances.
    
  Remarks:
    None.

/* Number of LUNs 
 
  Summary:
    Defines the number of LUNs per MSD function driver instance.

  Description:
    This constant sets maximum possible number of Logical Unit (LUN) an instance
    of MSD can support. This value should be atleast 1. In cases where multiple
    MSD Function Driver instances are required, this constant should be set to
    the maximum number of LUNs required by any MSD Function Driver instanceThe
    following figure shows a pictorial representation of the MSD function driver
    initialization data structure.
    
  Remarks:
    None.
